<!--
Thank you for contributing to New Relic's Azure Functions integration! Before submitting your pull request, please review our contribution guidelines:

* https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-azure-functions/blob/master/README.md#contributing

Following these best practices will help us review and merge your PR faster.

- When making updates to your PR, please add new commits instead of squashing. The PR will be squashed when merged.

- Don't force-push commit to branches during a PR review. When contributors do so, comments no longer appear where they were originally placed.

- When a reviewer includes a comment in your code, please answer to that comment stating whether you addressed it or you think it's best to do it in another way. This lets reviewer know whether you actually read that feedback, otherwise some comments may go unaddressed

- Please test your changes before pushing. Once pushed, GitHub Actions will run checks. Ensure these checks pass before requesting a PR review.
