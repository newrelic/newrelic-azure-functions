An Azure Resource Manager template to export Azure Platform logs to New Relic.

## How Does It Work?
This integration creates and configures the Azure resources necessary to efficiently forwards logs from an Azure Event Hub to New Relic. 
It relies on events managed by Azure Event Hub, Event Hub subsequently batches and triggers an Azure Function to handle the transport to New Relic.

Currently, this integration allows you to create resources to targets Azure Activity logs. If you have other log events that you would like to see shipped using Event hub trigger, [tell us about your use case](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-azure-functions/issues).

## Installation
This integration requires both a New Relic and Azure account.

### Install Using Azure Portal
Retrieve your [New Relic License Key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key).
Then click the button below to start the installation process via the Azure Portal.

![ehub-template-diagram](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-azure-functions/blob/master/screenshots/EventHub/ehub-template-diagram.png?raw=true)

## Manually create an Azure Function App

1. Log in to the Azure Portal and create a new [Function App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-azure-function).
2. Add the following in the **Instance Details** section of the **Basics** tab:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
|Publish|Code|
|Runtime stack|Node.js|
|Version|12|

![ehub1](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-azure-functions/blob/master/screenshots/EventHub/ehub1.png?raw=true)

3. Select the **Hosting** tab and select **Windows** as the Operating System
4. Fill out remaining required fields as desired and **Create** your Function App.

### Create and Deploy the Azure Function

1. Once your function app has been created, expand it and select the `+` button next to **Functions** 
![func-plus](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-azure-functions/blob/master/screenshots/EventHub/func-plus.png?raw=true)
2. Click **In-portal** followed by **More templates...**. Next click **Finish and view templates**.
![ehub3](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-azure-functions/blob/master/screenshots/EventHub/ehub3.png?raw=true)
3. Search for "event hub" and select **Azure Event Hub trigger**
![ehub5](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-azure-functions/blob/master/screenshots/EventHub/ehub5.png?raw=true)
4. Define the desired **Name**, **Event Hub connection** and **Event Hub name** of the Event Hub to collect logs from, as well as the **Event Hub consumer group**
![ehub6](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-azure-functions/blob/master/screenshots/EventHub/ehub6.png?raw=true)
5. Paste the New Relic [function code](index.js) in the function's existing `index.js` and click **Save**.
6. Navigate to the **Integrate** tab and verify **Event parameter name** is set to `eventHubMessages` and **Event Hub Cardinality** is set to `Many`.
![ehub7](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-azure-functions/blob/master/screenshots/EventHub/ehub7.png?raw=true)
7. [Configure](#azure-application-settings) your function's Application settings and define the desired application settings. `NR_INSERT_KEY` must be configured here.
